# Implementing-MoniPoly-Set-Commitment-Scheme-as-Proof-of-Storage

Please refer to Guide for detailed instructions.

**Overview**

Nowadays, cloud storage system has become a common platform to store data online. Proof of Storage (PoS) is an effective mechanism to verify data integrity without revealing full data value to the verifier. 
This final year project implements a PoS system using the MoniPoly set commitment scheme (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64840-4_17). 

**Objectives**
- Ensure the security and integrity of stored data.
- To support expressive proofs, which are difference proofs and intersection proofs.

**Future Enhancement**
The proposed PoS system has potential applications across multiple industries that rely on secure data storage, such as:
- Cloud storage providers
- Medical data services
- Financial data management
