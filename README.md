# Implementing-MoniPoly-Set-Commitment-Scheme-as-Proof-of-Storage

Please refer to Guide for detailed instructions.

Nowadays, cloud storage system has become a common platform to store data online. One of the approaches to 
ensure data security and integrity is by Proof of Storage (PoS). PoS is a cryptographic 
protocol implemented to verify the integrity of stored data. In this project, the PoS system is set up using MoniPoly set 
commitment scheme. MoniPoly was chosen to implement PoS system as it can verify specific properties of a dataset, which includes difference 
proof and intersection proof. 

MoniPolyâ€™s key functions are created independently in C++ functions and exposed through a system to display 
how clients interact with storage suppliers.
