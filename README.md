# Implementing-MoniPoly-Set-Commitment-Scheme-as-Proof-of-Storage

Please refer to Guide for detailed instructions.

**Overview**

Nowadays, cloud storage system has become a common platform to store data online. Proof of Storage (PoS) is an effective mechanism to verify data integrity without revealing full data value to the verifier. 
This final year project set up a PoS system using MoniPoly set commitment scheme (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64840-4_17). 

**Objectives**
- To Protect the security of data.
- To support expressive proofs, which are difference proofs and intersection proofs.

**Future Enhancement**
- The proposed PoS system may be useful in various industries providing data storage services.
- For example: cloud storage service, medical data service, financial data management service.
